# Release Notes

## v1.3.0
**"The Practice Suite Update"**

### New Features
*   **Tempo Trainer:** A smart practice tool that automatically increases BPM over time. Configurable Start BPM, End BPM, Step Size (e.g. +2 BPM), and Interval (e.g. every 8 Bars).
*   **Subdivisions:** Practice typical rhythmic patterns with synthesized subdivision clicks (1/8 notes, Triplet 1/3, 1/16 notes).
*   **Practice Timer:** A simple countdown timer (1-60 mins) to track your sessions. Ideal for Pomodoro-style practice.
*   **Setlists:** Organize your 50 presets into 5 distinct Setlists. Use "Long Press" on the Save Screen to assign a preset to a specific Setlist for better gig management.

### Improvements
*   **Audio Engine:** Completely rewritten synthesis logic to support three distinct click types: Accents (High/Loud), Downbeats (Mid), and Subdivisions (Short/Sharp).
*   **UI Updates:** Simplified "Menu" structure to house the new tools.

## v1.2.0 (2026-01-07)
**"The Jazz & Rhythm Update"**

### New Features
*   **Smart Taptronic:** Just tapping the beat is old school. The new algorithm now analyzes your dynamics (volume) to detect accents. It automatically sets the **Time Signature** (e.g., 3/4, 4/4) based on where you place the heavy beats.
*   **Extended Presets:** Increased storage slots from 5 to **50**. You can now save setups for your entire setlist.
*   **Complex Time Signatures:** Added support for odd meters often used in Jazz and Progressive music (5/4, 7/4, 5/8, 7/8, 9/8, 12/8).
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Tap sensitivity adapts to your playing style with distinct detection for "Beats" vs "Accents".

### Improvements
*   **Documentation:** Updated README with detailed Taptronic usage and functional overview.
*   **UI Tweaks:** Added visual feedback ("ACC!") in Taptronic mode when an accent is detected.

## v1.1.0
*   **Silent Mode:** Added specialized feedback mode where Volume 0 uses Haptics and LEDs only.
*   **Volume Focus:** Long-press encoder for quick volume adjustments without menu diving.

## v1.0.0
*   **Initial Release:** Metronome, Tuner, basic Presets, and OLED interface.
